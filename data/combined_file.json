You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up.

This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.",

When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary.

This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.",

It is found at the bottom of the dishwasher where it is attached to a rotating mechanism. When the dishwasher is in operation, water is pumped through the spray arm, which rotates to distribute this water through the dishwasher. This rotation ensures that water reaches all areas of the dishwasher tub for a thorough cleaning. If the spray arm is faulty, you may notice that some of your dishes are still dirty at the end of the cycle or you may hear unusual rattling noises while the dishwasher is running. The spray arm will need to be replaced if it can no longer function properly.",

It is made of rubber and has a diameter of approximately 2.5 inches. The grommet is used to create a watertight seal in the area between the inlet hose and the circulation pump. This prevents the dishwasher from leaking, and it also helps to absorb minor shocks and vibrations that occur while the dishwasher is running. It is normal for the grommet to wear down over time or become damaged from exposure to water, heat, and chemicals.",

Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.",

The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won\u2019t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won\u2019t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it\u2019s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.",

This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

When activated, the drain pump pushes the wastewater through the drain hose and into the household plumbing system or garbage disposal.

If your dishwasher does not dispense detergent, is broken and worn out, or the door is not opening properly, replacing the dispenser spring could be the solution. For this replacement you will need needle nose pliers. First, release the cover on the detergent dispenser, then remove the cover from the shaft it hinges on. Pull the shaft from one side and remove the spring from the shaft. Next, replace with the new spring and engage the two open hooks into the soap cover. Finally, grasp the hook and pull it over tab on the side of the wash cup. Verify that it works properly by opening and closing the cap. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions.",

The end cap is made of highly durable plastic, and it is responsible for securing the end of the handle on the dishwasher door. It protects the handle from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear, which can occur over time. It also contributes to the appearance of the dishwasher by concealing any exposed screws and providing a finished look to the handles. When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.",

The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won\u2019t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won\u2019t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it\u2019s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.",

It snaps into place on the appliance\u2019s pantry drawer to help contain the items inside and to keep your refrigerator door from sliding all the way out. It is rated as \"medium\" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.",

The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months.

A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

Over time, the door gasket can lose its elasticity or tear. In this case, you will likely notice frost build-up, increased noise, and inconsistent temperatures. Peel the faulty gasket off the refrigerator frame and remove any debris or residue on the surface. Carefully place the new seal along the edge of the door and press it firmly into place. Secure it with the appropriate fasteners and close the door to verify that there are no gaps between the door and cabinet.",

The tools needed for this repair project is a putty knife, Phillips and flat blade screw driver, 1/4 inch nut driver, and needle nose pliers. Remember to unplug refrigerator from power source as a safety precaution. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.",

A faulty defrost termination thermostat may result in the defrost heater never heating and a solid frost buildup on the evaporator coil, which results in too warm temperatures. The thermostat contacts are normally closed and have continuity until it reaches 140 degrees. If this high limit thermostat is open at room temperature or colder, it is defective. This limit thermostat has an attached mounting clip and comes with pink and amber wire leads. The thermostat is 1 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch thick, the 2 wire leads are 10 inches long.",

The assembly regulates the airflow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. When the refrigerator needs to cool down, the damper receives signals from the thermostat or control board to open and allows more cold air from the freezer to enter the refrigerator compartment. When the desired temperature is reached, the damper closes to restrict airflow. If the damper assembly is faulty or damaged, your fridge will be unable to maintain the desired temperature levels. It may be either too warm leading to food spoilage or too cold leading to frost buildup.",

The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.",

        "item_description": "This evaporator fan motor circulates air to the fresh food compartments for efficient cooling. It powers the evaporator fan that draws air from the refrigerator and circulates it over the evaporator coils. Your fan motor has a long life cycle, but can burn out quickly if there is an obstruction preventing the fan from rotating.  If the fan does not operate, the freezer will not cool properly. This will affect the performance of the compressor. This evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer section of your refrigerator, behind the auger motor assembly. It is attached to the back wall. If you notice problems with your freezer then check to see if there is anything blocking a fan blade. If there is no obstruction, test the evaporator fan motor using a multimeter. Test the 2 wires that travel from the coil on the motor for resistance. If these tests indicate that the evaporator fan motor is at fault, it must be replaced. This part features 1 evaporator fan motor, which is metal and plastic, and comes in white/silver",

Once the lever is pressed, the door flap opens and allows the ice to dispense into your container. If your door flapper is broken, it could allow outside air to enter the freezer and alter the inside temperature. You may notice frost buildup surrounding the dispenser area. The door flap can disconnect from the dispenser lever, or the tabs that hold it in place may break. Frequent use may distort the sealing face and cause air leaks and frost buildup. This part mounts in the ice dispenser, and measures approximately 3.25 inches in diameter. It is constructed of plastic and rubber, and comes in white/black. This part is sold individually.",

These door handles are not sold individually, so we recommend replacing both handles at one time, or keeping the second one as a spare in case of future repairs. If you require the mounting blocks for the handle, these are sold separately. To make the repair, simply remove the screws at the top of the lower door, and replace the handle, screwing it into place.",

It is typically located at the back of the refrigerator, where it runs from the water inlet valve to the ice maker assembly. When the ice maker needs to produce ice, water flows through this tube and fills the ice maker tray, where it freezes into ice cubes. The fill tube is an essential component of the ice maker system, ensuring a steady supply of water for ice production. If the fill tube becomes clogged or damaged, it can water leaks inside the refrigerator and also lead to difficulties producing ice when needed.",

The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.",

The rollers allow users to easily and conveniently access the contents of the drawers. Over time, the roller may wear down, break, or fall off. If the roller is faulty, you may notice difficulty sliding the drawer in and out, or the drawer may feel loose and unstable when you pull it out. Each crisper pan roller is sold individually.

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.",

The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.",

It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.",

The second is to provide physical filtration. This means trapping moisture, small metal chips, and dirt found in the refrigerant gas. If your refrigerator motor is constantly running, but the refrigerator is not getting cold, the issue could be due to a damaged or faulty filter-drier. Faulty filter-driers are sometimes the cause for abnormal freezer compartment temperatures and partially frosted evaporators. This filter-drier is approximately 11 inches long. Remember to disconnect the power from your refrigerator before beginning this repair.",

When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.",

It acts as a barrier between the contents of the drawer and the external environment of the refrigerator. It protects the contents of the crisper drawer from debris, odors, and other contaminants that may be present. The front panel also helps to control the amount of airflow and humidity within the drawer, helping to keep fruits and vegetables fresh longer. It also contributes to the overall appearance of the refrigerator, providing a finished look to the crisper drawer. If the front panel is damaged, it may become difficult to slide the crisper drawer back and forth and the freshness of the food may be compromised.",

It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.",
